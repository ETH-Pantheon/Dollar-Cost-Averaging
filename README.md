# Athene-Dollar Cost Averaging.
Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy in which an investor divides up the total amount to be invested across periodic purchases of a target asset in an effort to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase. The purchases occur regardless of the asset's price and at regular intervals; in effect, this strategy removes much of the detailed work of attempting to time the market in order to make purchases of equities at the best prices.[source]

Development of onchain Automatic Marker Makers (AMM) such as Uniswap, Curve, etc., generates a valuable oportunity for using DCA as an investment strategy on-chain. Unfortunatly, this requires manually executing transactions periodically given that the Ethereum Network does not support natively scheduling transactions. Furthermore, the high gas prices have become a barrier for small investors as sending periodical transactions could be prohibitely expensive.

Athenea solves this problems by integrating Aion Scheduling system with a set gas-efficient smart contracts. Athenea allows automatic execution of periodical purchases of a particular token in Uniswap. Furthermore, it allows users to get together and create voults, such that the gas needed to execute transactions is shared amoung participants, reducing significantly the cost associated with broadcasting transactions in the ethereum network. Athenea code is open sourced, the system is completelly trustless and users retain control of their assets at all times.
